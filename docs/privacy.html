    <h1>Flappy Market Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: July 8, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Flappy Market ("we," "our," or "us") handles information in connection with your use of the Flappy Market mobile application ("the App").</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Flappy Market is designed to be a simple, standalone game. We are committed to protecting your privacy and want to be transparent about what data, if any, is collected.</p>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information from users of the App.</strong></p>
    <p>The App does not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
        <li>Track your location.</li>
        <li>Access your contacts, photos, or other device data.</li>
        <li>Use analytics tools to track your gameplay or usage patterns.</li>
        <li>Contain any advertisements.</li>
        <li>Offer any in-app purchases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App saves your high score and game progress directly and solely on your device using standard local storage mechanisms (e.g., UserDefaults). This data is not accessible by us and is not transmitted over the internet.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Flappy Market is a general audience game and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Given that no personal data is collected from any user, this policy extends to all users regardless of age.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the App, please contact us:</p>
